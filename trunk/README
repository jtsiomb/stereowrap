About
-----
Stereowrap is an emulation layer implementing stereoscopic OpenGL visuals
ontop of non stereo capable OpenGL implementations. To do that it overrides,
using LD_PRELOAD, the GLX visual selection functions (glXChooseVisual and
glXChooseFBConfig), glDrawBuffer, and glXSwapBuffers to capture and composite in
a number of ways the two stereo images rendered by the application.

Currently stereowrap supports presenting the stereo images side by side
(cross-eyed stereo), or compositing them using various color anaglyph methods
such as red-blue, red-cyan, and color-code (aka amber-blue).

Public License version 3, or any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. See COPYING file for details.

Installation and Usage
----------------------
Just type "make" to compile stereowrap, and "make install" to install it. In
order to run a stereoscopic OpenGL program just type stereowrap, followed by the
name of the program. The stereo presentation method can be chosen using the -m
option (see stereowrap -h for help regarding the various options).

Example:
$ stereowrap -m redcyan glxgears -stereo

Note: command-line options to stereowrap must preceed the name of the program
you wish to wrap, any argument after that is passed to the program itself.

Patent Issues
-------------
The ColorCode3D anaglyph method is patented (US Patent #6687003). I live in the
EU so I don't give a shit, but if you care you may compile stereowrap with
colorcode disabled. Just modify the Makefile and add -DNOCOLORCODE at the end of
the CFLAGS line to do that.
